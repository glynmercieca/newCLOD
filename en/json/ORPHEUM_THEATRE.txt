    "description" : "The former Orpheum Theatre in Gzira is a splendid survivor of the large single screen cinemas on Malta. Like many of the island's old cinemas, it was flat floored in the stalls and had a single balcony. In 2001 it was Grade 1 Listed. The balcony is unaltered and magnificent with Spanish decor on the walls, a panelled ceiling and a painted shield in the centre. The theatre is famed for the filming of a video by the rock group Black Sabbath in 1995. A real delight!",
